description: >
  Capture thumbs up/down feedback into structured memories and prevention rules.
  Require one sentence of why before claiming memory promotion.
  Use when user gives explicit quality signals about agent work (e.g. "that worked",
  "that failed", "thumbs up/down"). Do NOT use for general questions, code generation,
  file operations, or any task that is not explicit feedback on prior agent output.
triggers:
  - thumbs up
  - thumbs down
  - that worked
  - that failed
negative_triggers:
  - generate code
  - search files
  - explain this
  - run tests

# RLHF Feedback Skill

When user provides feedback, execute:

```bash
# negative
node .claude/scripts/feedback/capture-feedback.js \
  --feedback=down \
  --context="<what failed>" \
  --what-went-wrong="<specific failure>" \
  --what-to-change="<prevention action>" \
  --tags="<domain>,regression"

# positive
node .claude/scripts/feedback/capture-feedback.js \
  --feedback=up \
  --context="<what succeeded>" \
  --what-worked="<repeatable pattern>" \
  --tags="<domain>,fix"
```

If the user only says `thumbs up`, `thumbs down`, `that worked`, or `that failed`, log the signal and ask one follow-up question before claiming it became reusable memory.

At session start, run:

```bash
npm run feedback:summary
npm run feedback:rules
```
