# Verification Evidence (March 9, 2026)

## March 10, 2026: Value-led GTM surfaces and hermetic ADK coverage

Commands:

```bash
npm ci
node --test tests/api-server.test.js tests/version-metadata.test.js
npm test
npm run test:coverage
npm run prove:adapters
npm run prove:automation
npm run self-heal:check
```

Observed result:

- `npm ci` completed successfully with `0 vulnerabilities`.
- Targeted landing-page verification passed: `25` tests passed, `0` failed across `tests/api-server.test.js` and `tests/version-metadata.test.js`.
- `npm test` passed end-to-end after the public messaging and GTM doc changes.
- `npm run test:coverage` passed with a serialized Node test runner (`--test-concurrency=1`) so suites that rewrite `process.env` do not race each other during coverage.
- The ADK consolidation path stayed hermetic under test:
  - first-run anchor-only consolidation no longer exits early
  - `ADK_FAKE_CONSOLIDATION=true` is honored only under `NODE_ENV=test`
  - the anchor-memory test opts into deterministic consolidation instead of a live Gemini path
- Coverage summary: `83.20%` lines, `69.28%` branches, `86.78%` functions.
- `npm run prove:adapters`: `24 passed`, `0 failed`.
- `npm run prove:automation`: `14 passed`, `0 failed`.
- `npm run self-heal:check`: `HEALTHY` with `4/4` checks healthy.

Evidence artifacts:

- Targeted landing/API verification was exercised directly by the commands above.
- `proof/compatibility/report.json`
- `proof/compatibility/report.md`
- `proof/automation/report.json`
- `proof/automation/report.md`

The command output above is the primary evidence for this run. The tracked proof artifacts listed here were refreshed locally by the proof commands and serve as machine-readable corroboration.

Requirements verified:

- Public-facing GTM surfaces now lead with one workflow outcome instead of generic agent infrastructure.
- The landing page preserves `SoftwareApplication` and `FAQPage` JSON-LD while adding buyer-facing FAQ and comparison content.
- The GTM plan link referenced by the landing page now resolves to `docs/GO_TO_MARKET_REVENUE_WEDGE_2026-03.md`.
- The ADK consolidator and spike/anchor coverage path is deterministic again and no longer blocks the proof gate.

## March 9, 2026: Symphony workflow contract and hermetic coverage

Commands:

```bash
npm ci
npm test
npm run test:coverage
npm run prove:workflow-contract
npm run prove:adapters
npm run prove:automation
npm run self-heal:check
```

Observed result:

- Clean install completed with `0 vulnerabilities`.
- `npm test` passed end-to-end, including the new `test:workflow` contract gate.
- `npm run test:coverage` passed after hardening `tests/adk-consolidator.test.js` to use explicit deterministic consolidation in test mode instead of relying on a live Gemini key.
- Coverage summary: `83.39%` lines, `67.58%` branches, `86.63%` functions.
- `npm run prove:workflow-contract`: `4 passed`, `0 failed`.
- `npm run prove:adapters`: `21 passed`, `0 failed`.
- `npm run prove:automation`: `14 passed`, `0 failed`.
- `npm run self-heal:check`: `HEALTHY` with `4/4` checks healthy.

- `proof/workflow-contract/report.md`
- `proof/compatibility/report.json`
- `proof/compatibility/report.md`
- `proof/automation/report.json`
- `proof/automation/report.md`

Requirements verified:

- Repo-owned `WORKFLOW.md` contract exists and encodes scope, hard stops, proof commands, and done criteria.
- Agent intake is bounded by `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/ready-for-agent.yml`.
- PR handoff now requires proof-first structure via `.github/pull_request_template.md`.
- CI runs machine validation for the workflow contract and uploads workflow-proof artifacts.

## Phase 6: Feedback Attribution

- Proof report: `proof/attribution-report.md`
- Machine evidence: `proof/attribution-report.json`

  - Rubric-aware context evaluation payloads
  - API auth config hardening (`RLHF_API_KEY` required unless insecure mode enabled)
  - Context namespace traversal rejection on API + MCP surfaces
  - Intent router checkpoint flow (`checkpoint_required` for unapproved high-risk intents)
  - MCP initialize/list/call flow (including `plan_intent` and rubric-gated `capture_feedback`)
  - MCP locked-profile write denial
  - OpenAPI parity for ChatGPT adapter
  - Gemini declaration validity

## Self-healing automation verification

Commands:

```bash
npm run self-heal:check
node scripts/self-healing-check.js --json > proof/automation/self-healing-health.json
node scripts/self-heal.js --reason=manual > proof/automation/self-heal-run.json
```

Observed result:

- Health status: `healthy` (4/4 checks healthy: budget, tests, adapter proof, automation proof)
- Self-heal execution: `healthy: true`, no failing fix steps
- Evidence artifacts:
  - `proof/automation/self-healing-health.json`
  - `proof/automation/self-heal-run.json`

## API smoke verification

Command sequence:

- Start API with `RLHF_API_KEY=test-key` on port `8791`
- `GET /healthz` with bearer token
- `GET /v1/feedback/stats` without token (expect 401)
- `POST /v1/feedback/capture` with valid payload
- `GET /v1/feedback/summary`

Observed results:

- Health endpoint responded with status `ok`
- Unauthorized stats call returned `401`
- Capture endpoint returned `accepted: true` and produced memory record
- Summary endpoint returned markdown summary payload

## Security regression checks

- Unauthorized API request returns `401` (default auth required).
- API initialization fails fast if `RLHF_API_KEY` is missing and insecure mode is not explicitly enabled.
- API rejects external output paths outside feedback root.
- MCP `prevention_rules` blocks external `outputPath`.
- MCP `export_dpo_pairs` blocks external `memoryLogPath`.
- MCP allowlists enforce profile-scoped tool access (`default`, `readonly`, `locked`).
- Rubric anti-hacking gate blocks unsafe positive memory promotion when guardrails fail or judges disagree.

## Autonomous GitOps verification

GitHub API checks:

- `allow_auto_merge: true`
- `delete_branch_on_merge: true`
- `main` branch protection retains:
  - required approvals: `1`
  - required check contexts: `["test"]`
  - required linear history: `true`
  - required conversation resolution: `true`

Workflow syntax validation command:

```bash
for f in .github/workflows/*.yml; do ruby -e 'require "yaml"; YAML.load_file(ARGV[0]); puts "OK #{ARGV[0]}"' "$f"; done
```

Observed result:

- All workflow files parsed successfully (`OK` for each).

## Budget status

Command:

```bash
npm run budget:status
```

Observed result:

- Month: `2026-03`
- Tracked spend: `0`
- Budget: `10`
- Remaining: `10`

## PaperBanana verification

Command:

```bash
npm run diagrams:paperbanana
```

Observed blocker:

- PaperBanana call reached Gemini endpoint and failed with `400 INVALID_ARGUMENT` (`API_KEY_INVALID`).
- This proves integration path is wired, but the provided key is not currently valid for generation.

Current status:

- Diagram pipeline is implemented and budget-guarded.
- Final diagram artifacts require a valid Gemini/Google API key.
- Failed generation attempts do not increase budget ledger spend.

## 2026-03-06 MCP startup hardening verification

Scope:

- Added MCP stdio transport compatibility for both `Content-Length` framed JSON-RPC and newline-delimited JSON requests.
- Fixed CLI `serve` bootstrap to explicitly start the stdio listener when loaded via `require()`.
- Removed duplicate/dead `serve` switch branch collision with `start-api`.
- Hardened proof/test reliability for external Subway repo discovery and proof test determinism.

Commands run:

```bash
node --test tests/cli.test.js tests/prove-adapters.test.js
npm run test:proof
npm test
npm run prove:adapters
npm run prove:automation
```

Observed results:

- `tests/cli.test.js`: pass (includes framed + newline `initialize` handshake coverage)
- `tests/prove-adapters.test.js`: pass with adapter proof checks increased to `>=21`
- `npm run test:proof`: pass (`75` pass, `0` fail)
- `npm test`: pass (all scripted test phases complete)
- `npm run prove:adapters`: `{ "passed": 21, "failed": 0 }`
- `npm run prove:automation`: `{ "passed": 14, "failed": 0 }`

Artifacts updated:

- `proof/compatibility/report.json`
- `proof/compatibility/report.md`
- `proof/automation/report.json`
- `proof/automation/report.md`

## 2026-03-09 Local Intelligence Verification

Scope:

- Hardware-aware local embedding profile selection with machine-readable fit evidence.
- Safe fallback embedding profile selection when the primary local profile fails.
- Boosted local risk scorer trained from RLHF feedback sequences.
- CLI surface for `model-fit`, `risk`, and `prove --target=local-intelligence`.

Commands run:

```bash
npm ci
node --test tests/cli.test.js
npm test
npm run test:coverage
npm run prove:adapters
npm run prove:automation
npm run prove:local-intelligence
npm run self-heal:check
```

Observed results:

- `node --test tests/cli.test.js`: `20` passed, `0` failed.
- `npm test`: all suites pass, including:
  - `tests/local-model-profile.test.js`
  - `tests/risk-scorer.test.js`
  - `tests/vector-store.test.js`
  - `tests/feedback-sequences.test.js`
  - `tests/feedback-loop.test.js`
  - `tests/prove-local-intelligence.test.js`
- `npm run test:coverage`: pass with overall coverage `82.86%` lines, `68.01%` branches, `86.00%` functions.
- `npm run prove:adapters`: `{ "passed": 21, "failed": 0 }`
- `npm run prove:automation`: `{ "passed": 14, "failed": 0 }`
- `npm run prove:local-intelligence`: `Status: PASSED`
- `npm run self-heal:check`: `Overall: HEALTHY` with `4/4` healthy checks.

Behavioral proof points:

- `FIT-01`: low-RAM override selects the `compact` embedding profile and writes `model-fit-report.json`.
- `FIT-02`: `vector-store` falls back to the safe embedding profile when the primary profile load fails.
- `RISK-01`: feedback capture flow trains and persists `risk-model.json` from sequence data.
- `RISK-02`: analytics expose boosted risk summary with `exampleCount=6`, `mode=boosted`, and top high-risk domain `testing`.

Artifacts updated:

- `proof/local-intelligence-report.json`
- `proof/local-intelligence-report.md`

## 2026-03-09 Technical Debt Audit Cleanup Verification

Scope:

- Added a portable `npm run test:coverage` command using Node's built-in coverage for `tests/**/*.test.js`.
- Removed the unused `stripe` SDK dependency; billing continues to use direct HTTPS calls in `scripts/billing.js`.
- Synced published version metadata across MCP manifests and public docs to `0.6.11`.
- Refreshed active proof artifacts and pruned stale milestone-era proof files that were no longer referenced.

Commands run:

```bash
npm uninstall stripe
npm test
npm run test:coverage
npm run prove:adapters
npm run prove:automation
node scripts/self-healing-check.js --json > proof/automation/self-healing-health.json
node scripts/self-heal.js --reason=manual > proof/automation/self-heal-run.json
```

Observed results:

- `npm test`: pass.
- `npm run test:coverage`: pass with Node test runner coverage summary:
  - line coverage: `81.61%`
  - branch coverage: `67.06%`
  - function coverage: `83.76%`
- `npm run prove:adapters`: pass with `21 passed`, `0 failed`.
- `npm run prove:automation`: pass with `14 passed`, `0 failed`.
- `self-healing-check`: `Overall: HEALTHY` with `4/4` healthy checks.
- `self-heal:run`: `healthy: true`, no failing fix steps.

Coverage caveat:

- `npm run test:coverage` measures `tests/**/*.test.js`.
- The inline script phases in `test:schema`, `test:loop`, and `test:dpo` still run in CI via `npm test`, but they are not yet folded into the single coverage percentage.

Artifacts updated:

- `proof/compatibility/report.json`
- `proof/compatibility/report.md`
- `proof/automation/report.json`
- `proof/automation/report.md`
- `proof/automation/self-healing-health.json`
- `proof/automation/self-heal-run.json`

Cross-project Codex startup proof:

```bash
cd /Users/ganapolsky_i/workspace/git/igor/trading
codex exec "Print OK only" --skip-git-repo-check
```

Observed result:

- MCP startup reports `ready: rlhf, sentry, github, context7, playwright`
- No `rlhf` timeout and no MCP handshake error
- Command completed with output `OK`

## 2026-03-06 Revenue Funnel + Billing Hardening Verification

Scope:

- Public top-of-funnel checkout endpoint (`POST /v1/billing/checkout`) with install correlation metadata.
- Append-only funnel telemetry ledger with acquisition/activation/paid stages.
- Admin boundary hardening: billing API keys cannot call admin provision endpoint.
- Funnel analytics endpoint (`GET /v1/analytics/funnel`) for conversion evidence.
- CLI install correlation (`installId`) persisted and linked to acquisition events.

Commands run:

```bash
npm run feedback:summary
npm run feedback:rules
npm run self-heal:check
npm test
npm run prove:adapters
npm run prove:automation
```

Observed results:

- `self-heal:check`: `Overall: HEALTHY` with `4/4` healthy checks.
- `npm test`: all suites pass; key monetization checks verified in:
  - `tests/api-server.test.js`
  - `tests/billing.test.js`
  - `tests/cli.test.js`
  - `tests/openapi-parity.test.js`
- `npm run prove:adapters`: `{ "passed": 21, "failed": 0 }`
- `npm run prove:automation`: `{ "passed": 14, "failed": 0 }`

Behavioral proof points:

- Public checkout succeeds without bearer auth and emits acquisition event.
- First authenticated billing-key usage emits exactly one activation event.
- Stripe and GitHub billing flows emit paid-stage funnel events.
- Static admin token is required for `POST /v1/billing/provision`; billing keys receive `403`.
- OpenAPI canonical + ChatGPT adapter include billing and funnel analytics routes with parity checks.

Artifacts updated:

- `proof/compatibility/report.json`
- `proof/compatibility/report.md`
- `proof/automation/report.json`
- `proof/automation/report.md`
