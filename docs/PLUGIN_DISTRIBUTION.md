# Plugin and Runtime Distribution

## Core principle

Ship one core runtime and fan out to platform adapters:

1. `src/api/server.js` (HTTP API)
2. `adapters/mcp/server-stdio.js` (MCP tools)
3. Adapter manifests/specs per ecosystem

This keeps maintenance low and supports a tight budget.

Intent routing and checkpoint policy are shared across platforms via versioned bundles in `config/policy-bundles/`.
Rubric scoring and anti-hacking guardrails are shared via `config/rubrics/default-v1.json`.

## Commercial packaging model

1. Ship OSS core first (this repo).
2. Offer managed hosted API + analytics as paid SaaS.
3. Sell enterprise controls (SSO, audit, retention policies, support SLA).

This avoids platform-specific rewrite cost and keeps the product under a `$10/mo` bootstrap budget until paid demand exists.

## ChatGPT (GPT Actions)

- Import: `adapters/chatgpt/openapi.yaml`
- Auth: bearer token (`Authorization: Bearer <key>`)
- Base URL: your deployed HTTPS API URL

## Claude (MCP)

- Use: `adapters/claude/.mcp.json`
- Transport: local stdio MCP server launched via `npx -y mcp-memory-gateway@0.8.2 serve`

## Claude Desktop Extensions

- Claude metadata: `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`
- Claude marketplace metadata: `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`
- Claude extension README: `.claude-plugin/README.md`
- Claude Desktop bundle launcher: `.claude-plugin/bundle/server/index.js`
- Claude Desktop bundle icon: `.claude-plugin/bundle/icon.png`
- Internal submission packet: `docs/CLAUDE_DESKTOP_EXTENSION.md`
- Bundle build command: `npm run build:claude-mcpb`
- Local install path: `claude mcp add rlhf -- npx -y mcp-memory-gateway@0.8.2 serve`
- Promotion rule: treat directory inclusion as a discoverability lane, not customer proof

Build the `.mcpb` for Claude Desktop review or direct installation with:

```bash
npm run build:claude-mcpb
```

## Codex (MCP)

- Merge section from `adapters/codex/config.toml`
- Transport: local stdio MCP server launched via `npx -y mcp-memory-gateway@0.8.2 serve`

## Cursor Plugins

- Public/team marketplace manifests: `.cursor-plugin/marketplace.json`
- Plugin source directory: `plugins/cursor-marketplace/`
- Plugin manifest: `plugins/cursor-marketplace/.cursor-plugin/plugin.json`
- Transport: local stdio MCP server launched via `npx -y mcp-memory-gateway@latest serve`
- Submission path: `https://cursor.com/marketplace/publish`
- Team fallback: import the GitHub repo through `Dashboard -> Settings -> Plugins -> Team Marketplaces`
- Cursor Directory: treat as a discovery surface, not the install/update surface

Cursor update rules:

1. `npm publish` can update the runtime path because the plugin launcher requests `mcp-memory-gateway@latest`.
2. `npm publish` does not update marketplace metadata, screenshots, README copy, or directory descriptions.
3. Republish or refresh the plugin bundle when marketplace-facing assets change.
4. For repo-backed Team Marketplaces, enable Auto Refresh when the Cursor admin UI exposes it.

Promotion and release operations are tracked in [CURSOR_PLUGIN_OPERATIONS.md](CURSOR_PLUGIN_OPERATIONS.md).

## Gemini (Function Calling)

- Use: `adapters/gemini/function-declarations.json`
- Map tool calls to API endpoints

## Amp (Skills)

- Use: `adapters/amp/skills/rlhf-feedback/SKILL.md`
- Run same capture/summary/rules loop commands

## Deployment notes

1. Set `RLHF_API_KEY` in hosted deployments.
2. Keep `RLHF_ALLOW_EXTERNAL_PATHS` unset in production.
3. Keep monthly spend bounded with budget guard scripts (`npm run budget:status`).
4. Enforce MCP least-privilege with `RLHF_MCP_PROFILE` (`default`, `essential`, `commerce`, `readonly`, `dispatch`, `locked`).

## Sales-ready evidence checklist

1. `npm test` output is green.
2. `npm run prove:adapters` produces [proof/compatibility/report.md](../proof/compatibility/report.md) and [proof/compatibility/report.json](../proof/compatibility/report.json).
3. README links to evidence + platform adapter files.
4. GitHub About text calls out cross-agent RLHF loop + DPO export.
5. Verification narrative is published in [docs/VERIFICATION_EVIDENCE.md](VERIFICATION_EVIDENCE.md).
