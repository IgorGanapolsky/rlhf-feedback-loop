# Cold Outreach Sequence: Platform Engineering Leads

**Target Persona:** Head of Platform Engineering, VP of Engineering, CTO at mid-market tech companies using GitHub Copilot / Claude.

## Email 1: The "Revenue-at-Risk" Hook
**Subject:** The hidden cost of "vibe coding" in your repos

Hi {{First Name}},

I noticed {{Company}} is scaling its AI developer tools. Platform teams I talk to are seeing a massive spike in "vibe coding"—developers letting agents write code without hard constraints.

The result is usually a spike in repeated agent mistakes (hallucinations, ignored style guides, skipped tests) that senior engineers have to manually fix. 

We built the **Agentic Feedback Studio** to solve this. It acts as a "Veto Layer" for your agents. When a developer flags a mistake, our system automatically generates a repository-wide guardrail so the agent NEVER makes that mistake again. 

Would you be open to a 10-minute demo to see how we calculate the exact Revenue-at-Risk from these repeated failures?

Best,
Igor

## Email 2: The "Zero-Config" Value Add (3 days later)
**Subject:** Zero-config guardrails for your AI agents

Hi {{First Name}},

Following up on my last email. One of the biggest hurdles to adopting an Agentic Control Plane is the setup.

That's why we made the Agentic Feedback Studio **Zero-Config**. You literally just drop `npx rlhf-feedback-loop install` into a repository, and it auto-discovers the context, integrating directly with Claude, Gemini, or Copilot via MCP. 

Platform teams use our Cloud Pro tier ($10/mo/user) to sync these prevention rules globally across every repository in the organization. 

If you have 5 minutes, I'd love to show you how our Vibe-to-Verification (V2V) pipeline works.

Best,
Igor

## Email 3: The Breakup (7 days later)
**Subject:** Closing the loop on agentic governance

Hi {{First Name}},

Looks like timing isn't right to discuss agentic governance and the Veto Layer. 

I'll leave you with our open-source repo. If your team starts feeling the pain of repeated AI hallucinations, you can run our Revenue-at-Risk analyzer locally (`npx rlhf-feedback-loop stats`) to see exactly what it's costing you.
