## Tweet 1 (Hook)

I got tired of my AI agent making the same mistakes across sessions. So I built an MCP server that captures feedback and blocks repeated failures.

rlhf-feedback-loop — open source, works with Claude/Codex/Gemini/Amp/Cursor.

## Tweet 2 (Solution)

One command. Zero config.

```
npx rlhf-feedback-loop
```

It's an MCP server that plugs into Claude, Codex, Gemini, Amp, or Cursor.

Captures feedback. Blocks repeated mistakes. Exports DPO training pairs.

Listed on the official MCP Registry. MIT licensed.

## Tweet 3 (How it works)

The loop:

1. Capture — thumbs up/down with context
2. Validate — schema-checked, timestamped
3. Learn — promotes patterns to memory
4. Prevent — generates guardrails from failures
5. Export — DPO pairs ready for fine-tuning

All local. All auditable. All yours.

## Tweet 4 (Social proof)

4 AI agents — Claude, Codex, Amp, Gemini — independently evaluated this in the same repo.

All four validated it works.

No orchestration. No prompting to agree. They each ran the tests and passed.

That's the best code review I've ever had.

## Tweet 5 (DPO angle)

Most RLHF tools stop at "collect feedback."

This one exports real DPO training pairs: chosen vs rejected completions with full context.

Feed them into your fine-tuning pipeline. Make your agent actually improve, not just apologize better.
