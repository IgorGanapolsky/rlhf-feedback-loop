**Title:** I connected Obsidian to Claude Code's persistent memory — here's the setup

---

**Body:**

Obsidian is my go-to for personal knowledge management, but I kept running into a mismatch: my AI coding agent (Claude Code) forgets everything between sessions while my Obsidian vault remembers everything. So I wired them together.

Here's what I built and how.

**The problem**

Every Claude Code session starts from zero. Same mistakes, same "oh I see, let me fix that," same patterns the agent was supposed to have learned. Obsidian is great for storing knowledge — so why not store the agent's memory there too?

**What mcp-memory-gateway does**

[mcp-memory-gateway](https://github.com/IgorGanapolsky/mcp-memory-gateway) is an MCP server that gives Claude Code persistent memory:

- You give thumbs up/down feedback on what the agent does
- It auto-promotes repeated failures into **prevention rules** — structured constraints the agent checks before executing any tool call
- Prevention rules are stored as a plain `.md` file: `.claude/memory/feedback/prevention-rules.md`
- Thompson Sampling gates adapt which rules fire based on success/failure rates
- Memory is captured in `.claude/memory/feedback/memory-log.jsonl` — a local, git-ignored file

None of this is cloud sync or real-time updates. It's local files that persist between sessions and get smarter as you use it.

**The Obsidian connection**

The [obsidian-claude-ide plugin](https://github.com/petersolopov/obsidian-claude-ide) (install via BRAT) adds a `/ide` command to Obsidian. When you invoke it on a note, Claude Code opens with that note's content as context.

My setup:

1. Create `AI-Memories/rlhf/` folder in your vault
2. Symlink the memory files into it:
   - `Prevention Rules.md` → `.claude/memory/feedback/prevention-rules.md`
   - `Primer.md` → `primer.md` (active session context: next steps, blockers, revenue truth)
3. Periodically paste `npm run feedback:stats` output into a `Feedback Stats.md` note
4. Open any memory note, run `/ide` — Claude Code reads your vault note as context and can write back updates

**What you see in Obsidian**

- Prevention rules as browsable, searchable notes
- Graph view connections between memory notes as the feedback loop runs
- Session primer always visible — what was last completed, what's next
- Feedback stats in a dedicated note updated as often as you want

**Full setup guide:** `docs/OBSIDIAN_SETUP.md` in the repo

**What I did NOT build (and won't claim)**

- No real-time Obsidian sync
- No auto-updating vault notes (you run the commands, you control it)
- No cloud storage of your memory (all local, all git-ignored)

It's a personal knowledge loop, not a SaaS product pretending to be one.

**Setup in 3 minutes:**

```bash
# 1. Add to Claude Code MCP config
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "mcp-memory-gateway": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["mcp-memory-gateway", "serve"]
    }
  }
}

# 2. In Obsidian: BRAT > Add Beta Plugin > petersolopov/obsidian-claude-ide

# 3. Create AI-Memories/rlhf/ in your vault and symlink memory files
```

Open source, MIT licensed. Core is free. There's a $49 one-time Pro tier for hosted dashboard
and multi-repo sync, but the memory system works fully offline.

Happy to answer questions about the prevention rules system or the Obsidian setup — this is
genuinely how I use it daily.
