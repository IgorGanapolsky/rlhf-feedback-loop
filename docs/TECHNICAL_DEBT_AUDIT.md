# Technical Debt Audit

> Live audit snapshot for March 20, 2026 on `codex/tech-debt-audit-20260320`. This supersedes the older historical note. Verification evidence for this audit is recorded in `docs/VERIFICATION_EVIDENCE.md`.

## Scope

Repository-wide audit performed in dedicated worktrees only. Metrics below use tracked repository files and exclude `node_modules/` trees. Runtime `.rlhf/*` artifacts were reviewed locally during the audit but not committed.

## Audit Report

Files scanned: 573
Issues found: 5
Issues fixed: 5
Files deleted: 1
Lines removed: 3119 net
RAG entries cleaned: 0 tracked entries changed; local runtime lessons reviewed and kept local-only
```

CI after: verified locally before PR creation; GitHub Actions link added after merge
```

## Fixed Debt

1. `scripts/pr-manager.js`: no longer crashes when the current worktree branch has no PR; it now falls back to repo-wide open PR inspection and returns a clean noop when none exist.
2. `tests/pr-manager.test.js`: expanded coverage for no-PR, open-PR fallback, noop, and repo-wide merge-ready paths.
3. `package.json`: `npm test` now includes the previously omitted operational test bucket via `test:ops`.
4. `tests/test-suite-parity.test.js`: added a guard that fails if any repository test file is omitted from `npm test`.
5. `test_output.txt`: deleted as a stale checked-in test transcript with no runtime or documentation references.

## Deleted Files

- `test_output.txt` — obsolete captured `npm test` output. It was not referenced anywhere in code, docs, scripts, or CI.

## Test Coverage Report

```

## CI Health Report

Pipeline status: locally passing before PR creation
Flaky tests fixed: 0
New checks added: test:ops, npm-test parity guard for repository test files
```

## Core-System Snapshot

- AI RAG reliability: `tests/contextfs.test.js`, `tests/feedback-to-memory.test.js`, and `tests/vector-store.test.js` passed in the baseline snapshot.
- Orchestration functionality: `tests/mcp-server.test.js`, `tests/intent-router.test.js`, and `tests/async-job-runner.test.js` passed in the baseline snapshot.
- Monitoring and health: `npm run self-heal:check` finished `4/4 healthy` before and after cleanup.
- CI pipeline status: GitHub `main` was green on `fb78e8ae1a36dbdb92dd93867a278c60c92a41c0` before the audit started.

## Security Summary

- `npm audit --json`: `0` vulnerabilities.
- `npm --prefix workers audit --json`: `0` vulnerabilities.
- GitHub code scanning, Dependabot, and secret scanning were already at `0` open alerts before this audit branch.

## RAG Cleanup Summary

- Queried local feedback memory and runtime state before editing.
- Reviewed the local runtime lessons created during verification.
- Kept all `.rlhf/*` runtime artifacts local and uncommitted, per repo policy.
