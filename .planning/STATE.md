# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-03-04)

**Core value:** Every synced feature has tests, passes CI, and produces verification evidence — no tech debt
**Current focus:** Phase 1: Contract Alignment

## Current Position

Phase: 1 of 5 (Contract Alignment)
Plan: 3 of 3 in current phase
Status: Phase 1 complete — ready for Phase 2 and Phase 3 (parallel)
Last activity: 2026-03-04 — Plan 1-03 complete: parseTimestamp rlhf-side + baseline test count; Phase 1 all done

Progress: [██░░░░░░░░] 20%

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

- [Init]: Cherry-pick best features from each repo — no full merge, library/prototype boundary preserved
- [Init]: Both sync directions run simultaneously — ML into rlhf-feedback-loop, governance into Subway
- [Init]: Phases 2 and 3 are independent and can run in parallel after Phase 1 clears
- [Init]: $10/month budget cap enforced by budget-guard.js on all API calls
- [Phase 01-contract-alignment]: parseTimestamp() uses new Date(String(ts).trim()) returning null for invalid input — CNTR-03 rlhf side complete
- [Phase 01-contract-alignment]: Baseline node-runner count is 60 (58 test:api + 2 test:proof) — authoritative Phase 2 and Phase 3 start gate in proof/baseline-test-count.md

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- [Phase 4]: Lance file format version compatibility (Python 0.27.1 vs Node.js 0.26.2) not definitively resolved — must verify before Phase 4 implementation
- [Phase 3]: Subway lint:fix behavior under auto-import-sort not confirmed — must audit `.eslintrc.js` before enabling self-heal
