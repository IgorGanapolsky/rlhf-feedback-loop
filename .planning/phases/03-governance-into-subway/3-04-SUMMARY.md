# Phase 3 Plan 04: Governance into Subway Proof Report Summary

**Phase 3 proof report generated with actual smoke test output for all 6 GOV requirements; GOV-01..GOV-06 all marked complete; Phase 3 certified done with 43 Subway governance tests passing and 91 rlhf baseline tests green.**

## Performance

- **Duration:** 15 min
- **Started:** 2026-03-04T19:40:00Z
- **Completed:** 2026-03-04T19:55:00Z
- **Tasks:** 1
- **Files modified:** 4

## Accomplishments

- Ran all governance smoke tests and captured actual output (no placeholders):
  - budget-guard: $0.25 spend tracked; $0.20 vs $0.10 budget rejected with exact error
  - intent-router: `publish_dpo_training_data` (risk=high) returns `checkpoint_required` with `human_approval` checkpoint
  - contextfs: `constructContextPack` confirmed as function
  - self-healing-check: `DEFAULT_CHECKS` = `[budget_status, lint_check, format_check, test_ci]`
- Ran `npm run test:governance` in Subway: 5 suites, 43 tests, 0 failures
- Ran `npm test` in rlhf: 91 node-runner tests (89 + 2 proof), 0 failures — no regression
- Created `proof/governance-into-subway/gov-sync-report.md` with all evidence
- Marked GOV-02 and GOV-06 as `[x]` complete in REQUIREMENTS.md (01, 03, 04, 05 already marked in prior plans)
- Updated ROADMAP.md Phase 3 row: `4/4 | Complete | 2026-03-04`
- Updated STATE.md: Phase 3 complete, next focus Phase 4

## Task Commits

1. **Phase 3 proof report + all planning artifacts updated** — `bb86d40` (feat)

## Files Created/Modified

- `proof/governance-into-subway/gov-sync-report.md` — Phase 3 proof with actual smoke test evidence for GOV-01..GOV-06
- `.planning/REQUIREMENTS.md` — GOV-02, GOV-06 marked [x]; traceability table updated to Complete
- `.planning/ROADMAP.md` — Phase 3 checkbox marked [x]; progress table shows 4/4 Complete 2026-03-04
- `.planning/STATE.md` — Phase 3 complete, next focus Phase 4

## Decisions Made

1. **Proof uses actual CLI output**: Ran every smoke test live and pasted exact JSON/text output into the report. No invented numbers, no approximations.

2. **GOV-02 correction**: REQUIREMENTS.md had GOV-02 as `[ ]` Pending despite Plan 3-02 completing it. This plan corrected it to `[x]`.

3. **rlhf baseline is 91, not 60**: Phase 2 added 29 ML tests; the current baseline is 91 (89 test:api + 2 test:proof). The Phase 3 requirement was "no regression from Phase 1" (60 minimum) — confirmed, 91 >> 60.

## Deviations from Plan

None — plan executed exactly as written.

## Issues Encountered

None.
