# Phase 6 Plan 4: Proof Gate + npm Scripts + Requirements Closure Summary

Proof gate script `prove-attribution.js` created, wired into `package.json`, generates `proof/attribution-report.{md,json}` with all 3 ATTR requirements passing (passed:3, failed:0), and Phase 6 closed in ROADMAP + STATE.

## What Was Built

### Task 1: prove-attribution.js + package.json + VERIFICATION_EVIDENCE.md

- **`scripts/prove-attribution.js`** (280 lines): Phase 6 proof gate script mirroring `prove-rlaif.js` structure exactly.
  - ATTR-01: Invokes `recordAction('Bash', '{"command":"git push --force"}')` → asserts ok=true, intent=git-risk; calls `attributeFeedback('negative', ...)` → asserts attributions JSONL written with valid attribution_id + signal=negative
  - ATTR-02: Seeds attributed-feedback.jsonl with 3 negative "git push force" entries; calls `buildHybridState()` → asserts count>=3 pattern detected; `evaluatePretoolFromState(..., 'Bash', 'git push force main')` → block; `evaluatePretoolFromState(..., 'Read', 'some-unrelated-file.md')` → allow
  - ATTR-03: `execSync('node --test tests/feedback-attribution.test.js tests/hybrid-feedback-context.test.js')` → asserts pass>=1, fail=0
  - Writes `proof/attribution-report.json` `{summary:{passed:3,failed:0}}` and `proof/attribution-report.md` with per-requirement table
  - Exits 0 if no failures, exits 1 if any failures

- **`package.json`**: Two changes:
  - `test:api` extended with `tests/feedback-attribution.test.js tests/hybrid-feedback-context.test.js` (test:api grows from 93 to 114 tests)
  - `prove:attribution` script added: `node scripts/prove-attribution.js`

- **`docs/VERIFICATION_EVIDENCE.md`**: Phase 6 section added at top referencing proof/attribution-report.md and proof/attribution-report.json

- **Proof files generated** with real test output (no placeholders):
  - `proof/attribution-report.json`: `{"summary":{"passed":3,"failed":0}}`
  - `proof/attribution-report.md`: all 3 ATTR sections with PASS status and evidence from actual runs

### Task 2: ROADMAP.md + STATE.md

- **`ROADMAP.md`**: Phase 6 marked `[x] Complete 2026-03-04`; all 4 plans marked `[x]`; progress table row updated to `4/4 | Complete | 2026-03-04`
- **`STATE.md`**: Current position advanced to Phase 7; 3 Phase 6 closure decisions added; session continuity updated

## Verification Evidence

```
node scripts/prove-attribution.js
# Output:
# passed: 3  failed: 0
# PASS — all requirements satisfied.
# EXIT 0 OK

npm test 2>&1 | grep "^ℹ (tests|pass|fail)"
# test:api: 114 pass, 0 fail
# test:proof: 2 pass, 0 fail
# test:rlaif: 24 pass, 0 fail
# test:attribution: 21 pass, 0 fail
# Total node-runner: 184 tests (v1 baseline was 142)
```

## Deviations from Plan

None — plan executed exactly as written.

REQUIREMENTS.md already had ATTR-01/02/03 marked `[x]` and traceability table showing Complete from prior plans; no changes needed.

## Self-Check: PASSED

- `scripts/prove-attribution.js`: EXISTS (created, 280+ lines)
- `proof/attribution-report.md`: EXISTS (contains ATTR-01, ATTR-02, ATTR-03 all PASS)
- `proof/attribution-report.json`: EXISTS (summary.passed=3, summary.failed=0)
- `package.json` test:api includes `feedback-attribution.test.js`: VERIFIED
- `docs/VERIFICATION_EVIDENCE.md` Phase 6 section: VERIFIED
- `npm test` passes with count > 142: VERIFIED (184 total)
- ROADMAP.md Phase 6 marked Complete: VERIFIED
- STATE.md position = Phase 7: VERIFIED
