  patterns:
    - "getVectorStoreModule() lazy-require: identical try/catch pattern to getContextFsModule() — load module or return null, never crash"

key-decisions:
  - "upsertFeedback() placed AFTER appendJSONL (primary write) and all ML side-effects (appendSequence, updateDiversityTracking) — write ordering guarantees primary data is never at risk"
  - "No await on upsertFeedback() call — caller must not block on vector indexing latency"
  - "Silent .catch() swallows vector store errors — LanceDB table absence at test time causes expected silent failure, not test regression"

patterns-established:
  - "Module side-effect pattern: getXyzModule() + if (module) { module.fn().catch(() => {}) } — established by contextfs, ML, and now vector-store"

# Phase 4 Plan 02: Vector Store Wiring into feedback-loop.js Summary

**Non-blocking upsertFeedback() side-effect wired into captureFeedback() via getVectorStoreModule() lazy-require helper, auto-indexing every accepted feedback entry into LanceDB without risking the primary JSONL write.**

## Performance

- **Duration:** 54s
- **Started:** 2026-03-04T20:03:21Z
- **Completed:** 2026-03-04T20:04:15Z
- **Tasks:** 1
- **Files modified:** 1

## Accomplishments

- Added `getVectorStoreModule()` helper in `scripts/feedback-loop.js` using the identical try/catch lazy-require pattern as `getContextFsModule()`
- Wired `vectorStore.upsertFeedback(feedbackEvent).catch(() => {})` call after `updateDiversityTracking` in `captureFeedback()` — fire-and-forget, no await
- Verified placement: upsertFeedback fires only after primary JSONL write and all ML side-effects succeed
- All 89 existing tests pass with zero regressions

## Task Commits

Each task was committed atomically:

1. **Task 1: Add getVectorStoreModule() and non-blocking upsertFeedback() side-effect** - `3612376` (feat)

**Plan metadata:** (pending final commit)

## Files Created/Modified

- `scripts/feedback-loop.js` — Added `getVectorStoreModule()` helper (lines 50-56) and `upsertFeedback().catch()` block (after updateDiversityTracking in captureFeedback())

## Decisions Made

- Placement is strictly after all primary writes and ML side-effects — the vector index is an optional enhancement, never a blocking dependency
- No await: vector indexing may be slow (model load + Arrow insert) and must not slow down the feedback capture CLI
- `.catch(() => {})` silences errors from LanceDB table not existing yet — this is the expected state during test runs and first-time setups

## Deviations from Plan

None - plan executed exactly as written.

## Issues Encountered

None.

## User Setup Required

None - no external service configuration required.

## Next Phase Readiness

- `captureFeedback()` now fully integrated with LanceDB — every accepted entry is automatically vectorized and stored
- Phase 4 Plan 03 can proceed: semantic search via `searchSimilar()` is now populated with live data from captureFeedback() runs
- No blockers

## Self-Check: PASSED

- scripts/feedback-loop.js: FOUND
- .planning/phases/04-lancedb-vector-storage/4-02-SUMMARY.md: FOUND
- Commit 3612376 (Task 1): FOUND
- getVectorStoreModule() defined (2 occurrences - definition + usage): CONFIRMED
- upsertFeedback().catch() pattern present: CONFIRMED
- 89 tests pass, 0 failures: CONFIRMED
