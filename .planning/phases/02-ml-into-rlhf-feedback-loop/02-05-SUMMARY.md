# Phase 02 Plan 05: ML Scripts and Proof Report Summary

Wire up 4 Python trainer npm scripts and generate `proof/ml-features-report.md` with live captured evidence for all 6 ML requirements (ML-01 through ML-06).

## Tasks Completed

| Task | Name | Commit | Files |
|------|------|--------|-------|
| 1 | Add ml:* npm scripts to package.json | 586f497 | package.json |
| 2 | Generate proof/ml-features-report.md | 13839c0 | proof/ml-features-report.md |

## What Was Built

**Task 1:** Added 4 npm scripts to `package.json`:
- `ml:train` — `python3 scripts/train_from_feedback.py --train`
- `ml:incremental` — `python3 scripts/train_from_feedback.py --incremental`
- `ml:reliability` — `python3 scripts/train_from_feedback.py --reliability`
- `ml:sample` — `python3 scripts/train_from_feedback.py --sample`

Both `ml:reliability` and `ml:train` exit 0 on empty feedback-log (graceful empty-state handling already in the Python script).

**Task 2:** Generated `proof/ml-features-report.md` (171 lines) with real captured output for all 5 Phase 2 success criteria:
- SC-1: Thompson Sampling JS reliability JSON + Python CLI help output
- SC-2: timeDecayWeight at 0d (1.000000), 7d (0.500000), 30d (0.051271) — half-life confirmed
- SC-3: feedback-sequences.jsonl schema evidence (2 entries, targetReward=1, rewardSequence=[1,1])
- SC-4: diversity-tracking.json evidence (diversityScore=92.0, domains=[testing,debugging])
- SC-5: 89 node-runner tests pass (vs 60 Phase 1 baseline, +29 ML tests)

## Verification Results

```
npm run ml:reliability   → Exit 0 (prints THOMPSON SAMPLING RELIABILITY TABLE with alpha/beta per category)
npm run ml:train         → Exit 0 (prints "Trained model from 0 entries", saves feedback_model.json)
npm test                 → 89 pass, 0 fail (node-runner) + 2 pass proof harness
proof/ml-features-report.md → 171 lines, 5 SC sections, real numeric values
```

## Deviations from Plan

None — plan executed exactly as written.

## Self-Check

- [x] proof/ml-features-report.md exists (171 lines)
- [x] package.json has ml:train, ml:incremental, ml:reliability, ml:sample
- [x] npm test: 89 pass, 0 fail
- [x] ml:reliability exits 0
- [x] ml:train exits 0
- [x] All 5 SC sections present in report
- [x] Report contains actual numeric output (no placeholder text)
- [x] Commits 586f497 and 13839c0 exist
