decisions:
  - Stripe checkout URL is a placeholder (buy.stripe.com/STRIPE_CHECKOUT_URL) — requires Railway live deployment before real URL can be inserted
  - GPT Store submission includes both full openapi.yaml reference and inline minimal schema for quick copy-paste
  - MCP Hub submission targets both modelcontextprotocol/servers (official) and mcp.so (community) with separate checklists
  - Landing page is pure static HTML with no external dependencies — deployable to GitHub Pages or Vercel without build step

## What Was Built

### docs/landing-page.html
- Hero: "RLHF for AI Coding Agents — Stop Repeating Mistakes"
- 6 value prop cards (capture/score, prevention, Thompson Sampling, DPO export, 5 platforms, 314+ tests)
- Stats row: 5 platforms, 314+ tests, $0 to start, <5min time-to-first-signal
- Terminal demo: local npx init + curl to cloud API
- Pricing section: $0 OSS tier vs $49/mo Cloud Pro with Stripe Checkout button (URL placeholder)
- Pure static HTML — no build step, deployable to GitHub Pages or Vercel

### docs/gpt-store-submission.md
- GPT name, short description (50 chars), full description (300 chars)
- Instructions: capture up/down, summary, rules, DPO export
- 4 conversation starters
- OpenAPI actions schema (inline minimal + reference to adapters/chatgpt/openapi.yaml)
- Submission checklist

### docs/mcp-hub-submission.md
- Server name, short description, full description
- Install commands for local mode and Cloud Pro
- 6 MCP tools table (capture_feedback, get_feedback_summary, get_prevention_rules, export_dpo_pairs, get_feedback_stats, validate_feedback)
- 11 capabilities listed
- Dual submission checklists: modelcontextprotocol/servers PR + mcp.so form

### README.md
- Added Pricing section with $0 OSS vs $49/mo Cloud Pro table
- Quick Install section already existed (confirmed from Phase 15)

## Deviations from Plan

None — plan executed exactly as written. Stripe checkout URL uses placeholder pending Railway live deployment; documented in decisions.
