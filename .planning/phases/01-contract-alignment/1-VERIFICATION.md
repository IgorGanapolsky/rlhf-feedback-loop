# Phase 1: Contract Alignment Verification Report

**Phase Goal:** Both repos share a verified, compatible contract — function names mapped, schemas aligned, timestamps normalized — so every subsequent port is safe to execute
**Verified:** 2026-03-04T16:34:30Z
**Status:** gaps_found
**Re-verification:** No — initial verification

## Goal Achievement

### Observable Truths (from PLAN frontmatter must_haves)

#### Plan 1-01 Truths (CNTR-01)

| # | Truth | Status | Evidence |
|---|-------|--------|----------|
| 1 | Running `node scripts/contract-audit.js` produces a non-empty markdown report listing shared, rlhf-only, and subway-only exports for all 3 shared scripts | VERIFIED | Script exits 0, produces 3-script JSON; proof/contract-audit-report.md contains verdicts for all 3 scripts |
| 2 | The report correctly identifies feedback-loop.js as INCOMPATIBLE (captureFeedback vs recordFeedback divergence) | VERIFIED | Line 26: "Verdict: INCOMPATIBLE"; line 42: captureFeedback in RLHF-Only; line 50: recordFeedback in Subway-Only; line 83: alias map row documents divergence |
| 3 | The report correctly identifies feedback-schema.js as COMPATIBLE at the export level (7 shared exports) | PARTIAL | Report correctly shows COMPATIBLE verdict; actual shared count is 8 (parseTimestamp was added before audit ran). Discrepancy is documented in the report itself. Verdict is correct; count differs from plan prediction. |
| 4 | The report correctly identifies export-dpo-pairs.js as PARTIALLY COMPATIBLE (5 shared, 3 rlhf-only, 1 subway-only) | VERIFIED | Line 55: "Verdict: PARTIALLY COMPATIBLE"; shared: 5; rlhfOnly: 3 (DEFAULT_LOCAL_MEMORY_LOG, exportDpoFromMemories, readJSONL); subwayOnly: 1 (validateMemoryStructure) |
| 5 | proof/contract-audit-report.md exists and contains the alias map as evidence for CNTR-01 | PARTIAL | File exists, alias map exists with 5 rows. However, the rubric evaluation row (line 87) is stale — still says "CNTR-02 fix required" and "Subway silently ignores rubricEvaluation" even after CNTR-02 completion. |

#### Plan 1-02 Truths (CNTR-02, CNTR-03 Subway)

| # | Truth | Status | Evidence |
|---|-------|--------|----------|
| 6 | Subway's resolveFeedbackAction destructures rubricEvaluation from params — not silently dropped | VERIFIED | grep -c "rubricEvaluation" Subway's feedback-schema.js = 10; line 128: destructure confirmed |
| 7 | When rubricEvaluation.promotionEligible is false, Subway's resolveFeedbackAction returns `{ type: 'no-action', reason: 'Rubric gate prevented promotion: ...' }` | VERIFIED | Live test: `node -e "... resolveFeedbackAction({ signal: 'positive', whatWorked: '...', rubricEvaluation: { promotionEligible: false, blockReasons: ['score too low'] } })"` returns `no-action Rubric gate prevented promotion: score too low` |
| 8 | When rubricEvaluation is absent, Subway's resolveFeedbackAction behavior is unchanged (backward-compatible) | VERIFIED | Subway feedback-schema.js line 172-176: gate only fires when rubricEvaluation is truthy |
| 9 | parseTimestamp() exported from Subway's feedback-schema.js returns a Date for Z-suffix, no-suffix, and offset inputs | VERIFIED | Live: `node -e "const s = require('...')..."` → `function true true true` |
| 10 | parseTimestamp(null) and parseTimestamp('garbage') return null — never NaN | VERIFIED | Live test outputs: `parseTimestamp(null) === null` = true, `parseTimestamp('garbage') === null` = true |

#### Plan 1-03 Truths (CNTR-03 rlhf)

| # | Truth | Status | Evidence |
|---|-------|--------|----------|
| 11 | parseTimestamp() is exported from rlhf's scripts/feedback-schema.js | VERIFIED | Line 291: `parseTimestamp,` in module.exports; grep count = 3 (definition line 208, JSDoc line 197, export line 291) |
| 12 | parseTimestamp('2026-03-04T12:00:00.000Z') returns a Date — not NaN, not null | VERIFIED | Live: `parseTimestamp('2026-03-04T12:00:00.000Z') instanceof Date` = true |
| 13 | parseTimestamp('2026-03-04T12:00:00') (no Z) returns a Date — handles Python's Z-stripping pattern | VERIFIED | Live: `parseTimestamp('2026-03-04T12:00:00') instanceof Date` = true |
| 14 | parseTimestamp('2026-03-04T12:00:00+05:00') (offset) returns a Date | VERIFIED | Live: `parseTimestamp('2026-03-04T12:00:00+05:00') instanceof Date` = true |
| 15 | parseTimestamp(null) returns null and parseTimestamp('garbage') returns null | VERIFIED | Live: both return null |
| 16 | proof/baseline-test-count.md records 54 node-runner tests and 23 script-runner tests passing before Phase 2 | PARTIAL | File exists with real numeric counts; actual count is 60 node-runner (not 54) + 23 script-runner = 83 total. Plan expected 54 pre-Phase-1 figure; actual post-Phase-1 figure is 60. Plan note says "54 node-runner tests in ROADMAP refers to pre-Phase-1 baseline" — documented correctly in the file. |
| 17 | npm test exits 0 after all changes — no regressions | VERIFIED | npm test: test:api = 58 pass, test:proof = 2 pass, total = 60 node-runner, 0 failures |

**Score:** 5/7 must-haves verified (truth #5 and the rubric alias map gap constitute the one functional gap; truths #3 and #16 are partial but not blocking)

### Required Artifacts

| Artifact | Expected | Status | Details |
|----------|----------|--------|---------|
| `scripts/contract-audit.js` | Runtime export compatibility auditor for 3 shared scripts | VERIFIED | 199 lines (min_lines=60 met); exports `{ auditScript }`; CLI-guarded with `require.main === module`; uses `SUBWAY_ROOT` + `require()` + `fs.writeFileSync` |
| `proof/contract-audit-report.md` | CNTR-01 evidence: alias map with compatibility verdict per script | STUB (stale content) | File exists and contains verdicts; alias map row for "Rubric evaluation" is stale (says "CNTR-02 fix required" — incorrect post-CNTR-02) |
| `/Users/ganapolsky_i/workspace/git/Subway_RN_Demo/scripts/feedback-schema.js` | rubricEvaluation gate logic + parseTimestamp() | VERIFIED | rubricEvaluation: 10 occurrences; parseTimestamp: exported and functional; gate behavior confirmed live |
| `scripts/feedback-schema.js` | parseTimestamp() added to rlhf's feedback-schema | VERIFIED | Function at line 208, export at line 291, JSDoc at line 197 |
| `tests/feedback-schema.test.js` | 6-case node:test suite for parseTimestamp | VERIFIED | 38 lines (min_lines=30 met); 6 tests pass (confirmed: `node --test tests/feedback-schema.test.js` → 6 pass, 0 fail) |
| `proof/baseline-test-count.md` | Authoritative baseline test count | VERIFIED | Real numeric counts: 60 node-runner (58 test:api + 2 test:proof) + 23 script-runner = 83 total; contains "node-runner" keyword |

### Key Link Verification

| From | To | Via | Status | Details |
|------|----|-----|--------|---------|
| `scripts/contract-audit.js` | Subway's feedback-schema.js | `require(path.join(SUBWAY_ROOT, relPath))` | WIRED | Line 20: `SUBWAY_ROOT = '/Users/ganapolsky_i/workspace/git/Subway_RN_Demo'`; line 47: `require(subwayPath)` — dynamic path, not static string pattern |
| `scripts/contract-audit.js` | `proof/contract-audit-report.md` | `fs.writeFileSync` | WIRED | Line 187: `fs.writeFileSync(reportPath, reportContent, 'utf8')` confirmed |
| `tests/feedback-schema.test.js` | `scripts/feedback-schema.js` | `require('../scripts/feedback-schema')` | WIRED | Line 6: `const { parseTimestamp } = require('../scripts/feedback-schema')` confirmed |
| `scripts/feedback-schema.js` | `module.exports` | `parseTimestamp` in exports | WIRED | Line 291: `parseTimestamp,` confirmed in module.exports block |
| Subway `feedback-schema.js` | `resolveFeedbackAction` | `rubricEvaluation` destructure + promotionEligible gate | WIRED | Line 128: destructure; line 173: gate confirmed live |
| Subway `feedback-schema.js` | `module.exports` | `parseTimestamp` in exports | WIRED | Line 257: `parseTimestamp,` in Subway's module.exports confirmed |

**Note on key_link pattern mismatch:** Plan 1-01 specified pattern `require.*Subway_RN_Demo.*feedback-schema` but the script uses a dynamic path via `path.join(SUBWAY_ROOT, relPath)`. The link is functionally WIRED even though the literal pattern does not match. Verified by running `node scripts/contract-audit.js` which successfully loads all 3 Subway scripts.

### Requirements Coverage

| Requirement | Source Plan | Description | Status | Evidence |
|-------------|------------|-------------|--------|----------|
| CNTR-01 | 1-01-PLAN.md | Export mapping audit confirms all shared function names are compatible between repos | SATISFIED | `proof/contract-audit-report.md` is machine-generated evidence; 3 scripts audited with verdicts; alias map present |
| CNTR-02 | 1-02-PLAN.md | Schema divergence resolved — rubricEvaluation parameter handled consistently | SATISFIED (code) / STALE (proof artifact) | Both repos' `resolveFeedbackAction` handle rubricEvaluation identically (verified live). However, `proof/contract-audit-report.md` line 87 still says "silently ignores rubricEvaluation — CNTR-02 fix required" — stale alias map row in both the on-disk report and the generator source (`contract-audit.js` line 148). |
| CNTR-03 | 1-02-PLAN.md, 1-03-PLAN.md | Timestamp format normalized (ISO 8601 with Z suffix) across both repos | SATISFIED | `parseTimestamp()` in both repos; 6 tests pass; handles Z-suffix, no-suffix, offset, null, garbage |

### Success Criteria Verification (from ROADMAP.md)

| # | Success Criterion | Status | Evidence |
|---|-------------------|--------|----------|
| SC1 | Running `grep -n "module.exports"` across both repos produces an explicit alias map with zero unresolved name collisions | VERIFIED | `proof/contract-audit-report.md` alias map covers all divergences; runtime audit confirms 0 unresolved collisions in feedback-schema.js (8 shared, 0 rlhf-only, 0 subway-only) |
| SC2 | `rubricEvaluation` parameter is handled identically in both `feedback-schema.js` files with a documented diff resolution | VERIFIED in code, STALE in proof | Code: identical gate logic confirmed live in both repos. Documentation: `proof/contract-audit-report.md` alias map row is stale (says CNTR-02 still required). |
| SC3 | All timestamp fields in both repos produce valid `Date` objects when parsed through `parseTimestamp()` — no `NaN` values | VERIFIED | Live tests: Z-suffix, no-suffix, offset all return Date; null/garbage return null (never NaN) |
| SC4 | A baseline test count is recorded for both repos and CI passes green before any ports begin | VERIFIED | `proof/baseline-test-count.md` records 60 node-runner + 23 script-runner = 83 total; npm test exits 0 with 60 passing |

### Anti-Patterns Found

| File | Line | Pattern | Severity | Impact |
|------|------|---------|----------|--------|
| `scripts/contract-audit.js` | 148 | Hardcoded stale alias map row — "Subway silently ignores rubricEvaluation \| Behavior diverges — CNTR-02 fix required" | BLOCKER | Running `node scripts/contract-audit.js` regenerates `proof/contract-audit-report.md` with incorrect CNTR-02 status. The proof artifact is now misleading — it contradicts the actual implementation state. |

### Human Verification Required

#### 1. Subway Inline Test Suite

**Test:** Run `node /Users/ganapolsky_i/workspace/git/Subway_RN_Demo/scripts/feedback-schema.js`
**Expected:** Exits 0 with 44 tests passing (per 1-02-SUMMARY.md)
**Why human:** Subway's `feedback-schema.js` is listed in `.git/info/exclude` — it cannot be committed to Subway's git history and cannot run in automated CI. The inline test count can only be confirmed by running the script locally in the Subway repo context.

### Gaps Summary

**One functional gap blocks full goal achievement:**

The `proof/contract-audit-report.md` alias map row for "Rubric evaluation" is stale. The root cause is in `scripts/contract-audit.js` line 148 — the hardcoded string was written before CNTR-02 was completed and was never updated after Plan 1-02 finished. When the audit script is regenerated (as Phase 2/3 planners may do), it will overwrite the proof report with incorrect status for CNTR-02.

**Impact on goal:** The goal requires "both repos share a verified, compatible contract" — the alias map is the machine-verifiable proof artifact. A stale row that says "CNTR-02 fix required" when CNTR-02 is complete undermines the claim that the proof is accurate. Phase 2/3 planners reading the alias map will see a false signal.

**Fix required:** Single line change in `scripts/contract-audit.js` line 148, then regenerate the proof report.

**What is NOT a gap:**
- The shared export count being 8 vs 7 (plan predicted 7; actual is 8 with parseTimestamp; discrepancy documented in report)
- The baseline test count being 60 vs 54 (pre-Phase-1 was 54; post-Phase-1 is 60; correctly documented)
- Contract-audit.js using dynamic path instead of the static pattern in key_links (functionally wired, verified by running the script)
