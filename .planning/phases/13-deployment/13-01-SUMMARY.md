# Phase 13 Plan 01: Deployment — Container + Health Check Summary

**One-liner:** Multi-stage Dockerfile for Node 20 Alpine, unauthenticated /health endpoint with version+uptime, Railway config wired to /health — all verified locally with docker build + container smoke test.

## What Was Built

### 1. GET /health Endpoint (DEPLOY-03)

Added to `src/api/server.js` **before** the API key auth check so Railway health probes and load balancers can reach it without credentials.

```
GET /health → 200 OK
{
  "status": "ok",
  "version": "0.5.0",
  "uptime": 3.04
}
```

### 2. Dockerfile (DEPLOY-01)

Multi-stage build:
- **builder** stage: `node:20-alpine`, copies `package*.json`, runs `npm ci --omit=dev`
- **runtime** stage: copies node_modules from builder, copies `scripts/`, `src/`, `config/`, `adapters/`
- Non-root `rlhf:rlhf` user
- `/data` directory for runtime feedback logs
- `HEALTHCHECK` instruction points to `GET /health`
- `CMD ["node", "src/api/server.js"]`

### 3. .dockerignore

Excludes: `.git`, `node_modules`, `.planning`, `.agents`, `.claude/memory`, `.omx`, `.worktrees`, `tests/`, `proof/`, `docs/`, `.env*`, `*.log`

### 4. railway.json (DEPLOY-04)

```json
{
  "build": { "builder": "DOCKERFILE", "dockerfilePath": "./Dockerfile" },
  "deploy": {
    "startCommand": "node src/api/server.js",
    "healthcheckPath": "/health",
    "healthcheckTimeout": 30,
    "restartPolicyType": "ON_FAILURE"
  }
}
```

### 5. Deployment Tests (8 new tests)

`tests/deployment.test.js` covers:
- `/health` returns 200 without auth header
- Response body has `status: "ok"`
- Response body has `version` matching package.json
- Response body has numeric `uptime >= 0`
- Content-Type is `application/json`
- `PORT` env var wires correctly
- `RLHF_ALLOW_INSECURE=true` bypasses API key
- Feedback endpoint responds under insecure mode

## Verification Evidence

### Docker Build

```
docker build -t rlhf-feedback-loop:latest .
#20 writing image sha256:77ef6a2bd4af1a28ac15b1e9d34883b04f0482abcc21c93c3125547d92c29f78 done
#20 naming to docker.io/library/rlhf-feedback-loop:latest done
```

Build result: **SUCCESS** — image built with no errors.

### Container Smoke Test

```bash
docker run -d --name rlhf-test -p 18787:8787 \
  -e RLHF_ALLOW_INSECURE=true -e PORT=8787 \
  rlhf-feedback-loop:latest

curl http://localhost:18787/health
{"status":"ok","version":"0.5.0","uptime":3.04892471}
```

Result: **200 OK** — container starts, health endpoint responds.

### npm test (Full Suite)

```
Total tests: 322 (up from 314 baseline)
Pass: 322
Fail: 0
```

### Deployment Tests

```
✔ GET /health returns 200 without authentication
✔ GET /health returns status ok
✔ GET /health returns package version
✔ GET /health returns numeric uptime
✔ GET /health content-type is application/json
✔ PORT env var controls listen port
✔ RLHF_ALLOW_INSECURE=true bypasses API key requirement
✔ feedback endpoint returns valid JSON under insecure mode
tests 8 | pass 8 | fail 0
```

## DEPLOY-02 Status: Deployment-Ready, Pending Railway Account

DEPLOY-02 requires actual Railway account credentials and a live deployment. All required assets are complete:
- Dockerfile builds and produces a working image
- railway.json is configured with correct build/deploy/healthcheck settings
- Environment variables are fully configurable (RLHF_API_KEY, PORT, RLHF_FEEDBACK_DIR, RLHF_ALLOW_INSECURE)

To deploy: create Railway account, `railway login`, `railway init`, `railway up` — no code changes needed.

## Deviations from Plan

None — plan executed exactly as written.
