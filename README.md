The open-source RLHF Feedback Loop captures preference signals, generates prevention rules, and exports DPO-ready data for AI agents. Cloud Pro adds the hosted layer teams actually pay for: shared memory, provisioned API keys, funnel evidence, and team-safe workflow runs.

The best first paid wedge is not "agent infra" by itself. It is one workflow with a clear business outcome, such as lead-to-meeting, onboarding, or internal ops automation. This repo is the reliability layer behind that workflow.

## Why someone would pay

- They want hosted API keys instead of self-hosting the feedback and guardrail store.
- They need shared memory and prevention rules across operators, repos, or agents.
- They need proof-ready runs and funnel evidence instead of local-only logs.

## Quick Start

Add the MCP server directly in your client config:

| Platform | Command |
|----------|---------|
| **Claude** | `claude mcp add rlhf -- npx -y rlhf-feedback-loop serve` |
| **Codex** | `codex mcp add rlhf -- npx -y rlhf-feedback-loop serve` |
| **Gemini** | `gemini mcp add rlhf "npx -y rlhf-feedback-loop serve"` |
| **Amp** | `amp mcp add rlhf -- npx -y rlhf-feedback-loop serve` |
| **Cursor** | `cursor mcp add rlhf -- npx -y rlhf-feedback-loop serve` |

Optional auto-installer:

```bash
npx add-mcp rlhf-feedback-loop
```

## OSS vs Cloud Pro

The OSS package stays free. Cloud Pro remains a low-friction founding offer while the hosted workflow layer proves onboarding and retention.

| | OSS core | Cloud Pro |
|---|---|---|
| Price | `$0` | `$10/mo` |
| Feedback capture | Local MCP server | Hosted HTTPS API |
| Storage | Your machine | Managed cloud |
| DPO export | CLI command | API endpoint |
| Team sharing | Manual | Built-in |
| Onboarding | Self-serve | Checkout + provisioned API key |

## Best First Use Case

The most credible first paid workflow is a lead-to-meeting system:

- inbound or CSV lead intake
- enrichment
- account research
- draft generation
- approval step
- CRM sync
- audit trail and prevention rules

Cloud Pro sits underneath that workflow as the hosted memory, guardrail, and evidence layer.

## Architecture

![RLHF Feedback Loop Architecture](docs/diagrams/rlhf-architecture-pb.png)

Five-phase pipeline: **Capture** human signals → **Validate** with rubric engine → **Learn** via LanceDB vector memory → **Prevent** repeated mistakes → **Export** DPO pairs for fine-tuning.

![Plugin Topology](docs/diagrams/plugin-topology-pb.png)

Three-tier stack: external integrations (Claude, Codex, Gemini, ChatGPT via MCP/OpenAPI) → plugin orchestration (schema validation, Bayesian scoring, DPO export) → data persistence (JSONL, LanceDB vectors, ShieldCortex context packs).
