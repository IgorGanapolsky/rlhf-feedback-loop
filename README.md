**Make your AI agent learn from mistakes.**

Your AI coding agent makes the same errors over and over. It claims things are done when they're not. It forgets what worked last time. This fixes that.

**rlhf-feedback-loop** captures thumbs up/down feedback on your agent's work, remembers what went right and wrong, blocks repeated failures, and exports training data so the agent actually improves.

Works with **ChatGPT**, **Claude**, **Codex**, **Gemini**, and **Amp** — same core, different adapters.

### Plugin Topology

## Why This Exists

| Problem | What this does |
|---------|---------------|
| Agent keeps making the same mistake | Prevention rules auto-generated from repeated failures |
| No proof agent tested before claiming "done" | Rubric engine blocks positive feedback without test evidence |
| Feedback collected but never used | DPO pairs exported for actual model fine-tuning |
| Different tools, different formats | One API + MCP server works across 5 platforms |

## Install in 60 Seconds

```bash
npx rlhf-feedback-loop init
node .rlhf/capture-feedback.js --feedback=up --context="tests pass"
```

That's it. You're capturing feedback. Now plug it into your agent:

| Platform | One-liner |
|----------|-----------|
| **Claude Code** | `cp plugins/claude-skill/SKILL.md .claude/skills/rlhf-feedback.md` |
| **Codex** | `cat adapters/codex/config.toml >> ~/.codex/config.toml` |
| **Gemini** | `cp adapters/gemini/function-declarations.json .gemini/rlhf-tools.json` |
| **Amp** | `cp plugins/amp-skill/SKILL.md .amp/skills/rlhf-feedback.md` |
| **ChatGPT** | Import `adapters/chatgpt/openapi.yaml` in GPT Builder |

## How It Works

```
You give feedback (thumbs up/down)
        |
        v
  Capture + validate
        |
        v
  Score with rubric (is this actually good?)
        |
    +---+---+
    |       |
   Good    Bad
    |       |
  Learn   Remember mistake
    |       |
    v       v
  DPO    Prevention
  pairs   rules
```

1. You (or your agent) gives thumbs up or down with context
2. The rubric engine scores it — blocks false positives (e.g., "done!" with no tests)
3. Good outcomes become learning memories, bad ones become error memories
4. Errors generate prevention rules so the agent stops repeating them
5. Matched pairs export as DPO training data for fine-tuning

## Quick Start

```bash
cp .env.example .env
npm test
npm run prove:adapters
npm run prove:automation
npm run start:api
```

Set `RLHF_API_KEY` before running the API (or explicitly set `RLHF_ALLOW_INSECURE=true` for isolated local testing only).

Capture feedback:

```bash
node .claude/scripts/feedback/capture-feedback.js \
  --feedback=down \
  --context="Claimed done without test evidence" \
  --what-went-wrong="No proof attached" \
  --what-to-change="Always run tests and include output" \
  --tags="verification,testing"
```

## Integration Adapters

## API Surface

- `POST /v1/feedback/capture`
- `GET /v1/feedback/stats`
- `GET /v1/intents/catalog`
- `POST /v1/intents/plan`
- `GET /v1/feedback/summary`

Spec: `openapi/openapi.yaml`

## Versioning

- Package/runtime release version: `package.json`
- API contract version: `openapi/openapi.yaml`
- MCP server protocol version: `adapters/mcp/server-stdio.js` `serverInfo.version`

## ContextFS

The repo includes a file-system context substrate for multi-agent memory orchestration:
- Constructor: relevance-ranked context pack assembly
- Loader: strict `maxItems` + `maxChars` budgeting
- Evaluator: outcome/provenance logging for improvement loops

Docs: [docs/CONTEXTFS.md](docs/CONTEXTFS.md)

## MCP Policy Profiles

Use least-privilege MCP profiles based on runtime risk:

- `default`: full local toolset
- `readonly`: read-heavy operations
- `locked`: summary-only constrained mode

Config: [config/mcp-allowlists.json](config/mcp-allowlists.json)

## Rubric Engine

Rubric config: `config/rubrics/default-v1.json`

- Weighted criteria scoring (`1-5`)
- Multi-judge disagreement detection
- Objective guardrail checks (`testsPassed`, `pathSafety`, `budgetCompliant`)
- Promotion gate blocks positive memory writes on unsafe/high-disagreement signals

## Intent Router

Versioned orchestration bundles define intent-to-action plans and checkpoint policy:

- Bundle configs: `config/policy-bundles/*.json`
- CLI list: `npm run intents:list`
- CLI plan: `npm run intents:plan`

The router marks high-risk intents as `checkpoint_required` unless explicitly approved.
Details: [docs/INTENT_ROUTER.md](docs/INTENT_ROUTER.md)

## Autonomous GitOps

The repo now ships with PR-gated autonomous operations:

- `CI` (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`): required quality gate (`npm test`, adapter proof, automation proof)
- `Agent PR Auto-Merge` (`.github/workflows/agent-automerge.yml`): auto-merges eligible agent branches (`claude/*`, `codex/*`, `auto/*`, `agent/*`) after required checks pass
- `Dependabot Auto-Merge` (`.github/workflows/dependabot-automerge.yml`): auto-approves and merges safe dependency updates after required checks pass
- `Self-Healing Monitor` (`.github/workflows/self-healing-monitor.yml`): scheduled health checks, auto-created alert issue on failure, remediation PR generation when fixable
- `Self-Healing Auto-Fix` (`.github/workflows/self-healing-auto-fix.yml`): scheduled safe-fix attempts that open remediation PRs
- `Merge Branch to Main` (`.github/workflows/merge-branch.yml`): manual fallback that still uses PR flow and branch protections

Required repo settings:

- `main` protected + required check(s)
- auto-merge enabled
- branch deletion on merge enabled

Secrets:

- Required: `GH_PAT` (or rely on `GITHUB_TOKEN` where permitted)
- Optional: `SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN`, `SENTRY_DSN`
- Optional (LLM router): `LLM_GATEWAY_BASE_URL`, `LLM_GATEWAY_API_KEY`

## Semantic Cache (Cost + Latency)

Context pack construction now supports semantic cache reuse for similar queries:

- token-overlap (Jaccard) similarity gate
- TTL-bound cache entries
- full provenance (`context_pack_cache_hit`)

Environment toggles:

- `RLHF_SEMANTIC_CACHE_ENABLED=true|false` (default `true`)
- `RLHF_SEMANTIC_CACHE_THRESHOLD=0.7`
- `RLHF_SEMANTIC_CACHE_TTL_SECONDS=86400`

This directly reduces repeated retrieval/LLM context assembly work and improves response latency under budget constraints.
